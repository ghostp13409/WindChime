# WindChime - Cross-Platform Mindfulness Application

## Project Overview

**WindChime** is a comprehensive mindfulness and meditation application built with Flutter, designed to help users achieve better mental well-being through guided meditation, breathwork exercises, and mindfulness practices. The app provides an intuitive interface for exploring various meditation techniques while tracking progress across multiple platforms.

## Technical Implementation

### **Architecture & Technologies**

- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart) with cross-platform support for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for reactive UI updates and theme management
- **Database**: SQLite with cross-platform compatibility using `sqflite` and `sqflite_common_ffi`
- **Audio Processing**: Dual audio engine implementation using `just_audio` and `audioplayers` for high-quality playback
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for user preferences and app settings
- **UI/UX**: Material Design with custom dark/light theme implementation

### **Key Features Developed**

#### **Meditation System**

- **Guided Meditation Library**: Implemented comprehensive audio management system supporting 50+ meditation sessions across 6 categories (Body Scan, Breathing Practices, Brief Mindfulness, Guided Imagery, Self-Guided Sessions, Sitting Meditations)
- **Breathwork Engine**: Developed customizable breathing pattern system with audio cues for anxiety relief, focus enhancement, sleep improvement, and happiness
- **Session Management**: Built real-time meditation session tracking with progress indicators, pause/resume functionality, and background audio support

#### **Data Architecture**

- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented clean architecture with separate repositories for meditation and guided meditation data management
- **SQLite Integration**: Designed and implemented local database schema for session history, user progress tracking, and offline content management
- **Cross-Platform Database**: Ensured database compatibility across all target platforms including web using FFI implementations

#### **User Experience Features**

- **Onboarding System**: Created welcome tour and tutorial screens for first-time users
- **Session History**: Developed comprehensive tracking system showing meditation statistics, streaks, and progress over time
- **Theme System**: Implemented dynamic theme switching with provider-based state management
- **Haptic Feedback**: Integrated tactile responses for enhanced user interaction
- **Push Notifications**: Implemented local notifications for meditation reminders and session alerts

### **Technical Achievements**

#### **Performance Optimization**

- **Efficient Audio Handling**: Implemented optimized audio loading and caching system for seamless playback
- **Memory Management**: Utilized proper disposal patterns and lifecycle management for audio resources
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensured consistent functionality across 6 different platforms with platform-specific optimizations

#### **Code Quality & Architecture**

- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase into logical modules (data layer, models, providers, services, screens, widgets)
- **Reusable Components**: Created custom widget library for consistent UI patterns across the application
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for audio playback, database operations, and network requests

#### **Development & Deployment**

- **Build System**: Set up automated build configurations for all target platforms
- **Asset Management**: Organized and optimized 60+ audio files with efficient asset bundling
- **Version Control**: Maintained clean Git history with proper branching strategy and GPL-3.0 licensing
