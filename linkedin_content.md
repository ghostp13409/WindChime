### Option 1: Technical Achievement Focus

üöÄ Excited to share my latest project: **WindChime** - a cross-platform mindfulness app built with Flutter!

What started as a passion project to help people with mental well-being turned into a comprehensive meditation platform supporting 6 different platforms from a single codebase.

**Technical Highlights:**
‚ú® 60+ guided meditation sessions across 6 categories
üéµ Dual audio engine for seamless playback experience
üì± Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux)
üíæ SQLite database for offline functionality and session tracking
üé® Custom breathwork engine with audio cues for anxiety, focus, sleep & happiness
üìä Comprehensive progress tracking and user analytics

**The Challenge:** Building a smooth audio experience across multiple platforms while maintaining performance and user experience.

**The Solution:** Implemented efficient audio caching, proper lifecycle management, and platform-specific optimizations.

This project reinforced my belief that technology can be a powerful tool for improving mental health and well-being.

### Option 2: Personal Journey Focus

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **The problem that bothered me** for a long time was Every meditation app that I tried came with expensive subscriptions or limited free content.

As someone who believed mental wellness shouldn't be behind a paywall, I kept searching for truly free meditation apps. But here's what I found:
‚ùå "Free" apps with only 3-5 sessions before requiring payment
‚ùå Apps that needed constant internet connection
‚ùå Complicated Interface with 50 things thrown on you when you start the app

**So I decided to build the solution myself.**

Meet **WindChime** - a completely free, open-source meditation app that I built from scratch using Flutter:

‚úÖ 20+ research-based meditation sessions - all completely free
‚úÖ Works 100% offline - no internet required after download
‚úÖ Customizable breathwork patterns for anxiety, focus, sleep & happiness
‚úÖ Simple to get started, and consistent design

**The journey wasn't easy.** Building dual audio engines for smooth playback, designing cross-platform SQLite databases, countless pixel overflows on different screens - every technical challenge taught me something new about mobile development.

**The best part** about it is that I released it under GPL-3.0 open source license. No ads, no subscriptions, no premium tiers. Just free access to mental wellness tools for everyone. Because I believe that peace of mind shouldn't come with a price tag.

### Option 3: Problem-Solution Focus

üí° **Problem:** Existing meditation apps often lack customization, require constant internet, or don't work well across different devices.

**Solution:** I built WindChime - a cross-platform mindfulness app that works offline and adapts to user needs.

**What makes it different:**
üîÑ Fully functional offline - no internet required for sessions
‚öôÔ∏è Customizable breathwork patterns for different goals (anxiety relief, focus, sleep)
üì± Consistent experience across 6 platforms from single Flutter codebase
üìà Local data storage with comprehensive session analytics
üéß High-quality audio with background playback support

**Technical Stack:**
‚Ä¢ Flutter & Dart for cross-platform development
‚Ä¢ SQLite for local data management
‚Ä¢ Dual audio engine (just_audio + audioplayers)
‚Ä¢ Provider pattern for state management
‚Ä¢ Material Design with custom theming

**Key Learning:** Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to build the solution yourself. This project combined my passion for technology with mental health advocacy.
