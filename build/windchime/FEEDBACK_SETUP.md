# Feedback Form Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure the feedback form in your WindChime app using Formspree, a free form handling service.

## What is Formspree?

Formspree is a free service that handles form submissions and sends them to your email. The free tier includes:

- 50 submissions per month
- Spam filtering
- Email notifications
- No server setup required

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Formspree Account

1. Go to [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create a New Form

1. After logging in, click "New Form"
2. Enter a form name (e.g., "WindChime Feedback")
3. Enter your email address where you want to receive feedback
4. Click "Create Form"

### Step 3: Get Your Form ID

1. After creating the form, you'll see a form endpoint like:
   ```
   https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
   ```
2. Copy the `YOUR_FORM_ID` part (it looks like `xrbzgqjw` or similar)

### Step 4: Configure the App

1. Open `lib/screens/about/feedback_screen.dart`
2. Find line 33 with:
   ```dart
   static const String _formspreeEndpoint = 'YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID';
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID:
   ```dart
   static const String _formspreeEndpoint = 'xrbzgqjw'; // Your actual form ID
   ```

### Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Run your app: `flutter run`
2. Navigate to About â†’ Feedback (tap the feedback icon in the top right)
3. Fill out the form and submit it
4. Check your email for the feedback submission

## Form Features

- **File Size Limit**: Small files (< 50KB) are included in the email content
- **Large Files**: Larger files are noted but not included (Formspree free tier limitation)

### âœ… Device Information (Optional)

## Email Format

Subject: WindChime Feedback - [User's Subject]

Name: John Doe
Email: user@example.com
Subject: Bug Report - Audio not playing

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Email Templates (Paid Plans)

For more professional email formatting, consider upgrading to Formspree's paid plans which offer:

- Custom email templates
- Auto-responders
- Integration with other services
- Higher submission limits

### Alternative Services

If you need more features, consider these alternatives:

- **EmailJS**: Client-side email sending
- **Netlify Forms**: If hosting on Netlify
- **Google Forms**: Completely free but less customizable
- **Custom Backend**: For full control (requires server setup)

### Security Considerations

- The form endpoint is public but Formspree provides spam protection
- Consider adding rate limiting for production apps
- User emails are handled securely by Formspree
- Device information is optional and can be disabled by users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please configure Formspree endpoint first" error**

   - Make sure you replaced `YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID

2. **"Network error" message**

   - Check internet connection
   - Verify the form ID is correct
   - Check Formspree dashboard for any issues

3. **Emails not received**

   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address in Formspree dashboard
   - Ensure form is active in Formspree

4. **File attachments not working**
   - Large files (>50KB) are noted but not included in emails
   - Check file permissions on device
   - Ensure file types are supported (.txt, .log, .json, .xml for logs)
